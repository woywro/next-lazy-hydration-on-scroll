⚠️ **Pages Directory Only**  
This package is designed for Next.js Pages Directory, where streaming isn't available. If you're using App Directory, use [built-in streaming](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/streaming) for better results.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install next-lazy-hydration-on-scroll
# or
yarn add next-lazy-hydration-on-scroll
# or
pnpm add next-lazy-hydration-on-scroll
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { lazyHydrate } from 'next-lazy-hydration-on-scroll'

// Wrap your component with lazyHydrate
const LazyComponent = lazyHydrate(() => import('./components/HeavyComponent'), {
  LoadingComponent: () => <div>Loading...</div>, // Optional
})

// Use it in your page
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>Always hydrated</header>

      {/* This will hydrate only when scrolled into view */}
      <LazyComponent />

      {/* You can wrap multiple components */}
      <LazyComponent />
      <LazyComponent />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Understanding the Process

### What is Hydration?

When you visit a Next.js website:

1. The server sends HTML that you can see immediately (like a static webpage)
2. Then it sends JavaScript to make everything interactive:
   - Makes buttons clickable
   - Enables form submissions
   - Activates React hooks (useEffect, useState, etc.)
   - Sets up event listeners

Let's look at how this package transforms the traditional hydration process:

### The Traditional Approach

By default, Next.js loads and hydrates all components at once, even those not visible on screen. This leads to several issues:

- Slow down initial page load
- Delay page interactivity
- High memory usage during hydration

Traditional hydration process:

```
Load Page ──► Download All JS ──► Hydrate Everything ──► Page Interactive
            (blocking)         (blocking)
```

### The Solution ⚡️

This package breaks down the hydration process into stages:

1. Shows static content instantly
2. Detects when you scroll to components
3. Loads and hydrates components only when needed
4. Keeps your page fast and efficient

```
Static HTML ──► Scroll Detection ──► Load Component JS ──► Hydrate Component ──► Interactive
   🟢              🟡                    🔴                    🔴                  🟢
```

🟢 Instant/Interactive  
🟡 Lightweight operation  
🔴 Heavy operation (but only for visible components)

This approach provides many (some not obvious) benefits:

- Reduces Total Blocking Time (TBT) by splitting hydration work
- Reduces initial JavaScript bundle size
- Components with data fetching (useEffect, SWR, React Query) only trigger requests when hydrated

## Performance Impact 📊

The key improvement is in Total Blocking Time (TBT), which measures how long the main thread is blocked, preventing user interactions. By hydrating components gradually:

1. **Initial Load:**

   - Only essential components are hydrated
   - Main thread stays responsive
   - Users can interact with visible content faster

2. **Resource Usage:**

   - JavaScript is parsed and executed in smaller chunks
   - Memory usage stays lower
   - Network requests are distributed over time

3. **Data Fetching:**
   - Components that fetch data only do so when hydrated
   - Saves bandwidth for unseen components

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>With Lazy Hydration ✨</th>
      <th>Without Lazy Hydration</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="optimized.png" alt="Optimized" width="400"/>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="unoptimized.png" alt="Unoptimized" width="400"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>✓ Faster Time to Interactive</td>
      <td>× Longer Loading Times</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>✓ Lower Memory Usage</td>
      <td>× Higher Memory Usage</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>✓ Better User Experience</td>
      <td>× Potential UI Freezes</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

## Implementation Notes ⚙️

### File Structure Requirements

- Keep components in separate files
- **Avoid barrel files** (index.ts that re-exports components):

  ```ts
  // ❌ Don't use barrel files like this:
  // components/index.ts
  export { ComponentA } from './ComponentA'
  export { ComponentB } from './ComponentB'

  // This will bundle all components together, defeating lazy loading
  ```

  ```ts
  // ✅ Instead, import directly:
  import { ComponentA } from './components/ComponentA'
  import { ComponentB } from './components/ComponentB'
  ```

This is important because webpack code splits on file boundaries. When using barrel files, all re-exported components get bundled into a single chunk, defeating the purpose of lazy loading.

### Common Misconceptions

- **next/dynamic alone isn't enough:**

  ```tsx
  // ❌ This still executes on initial load:
  const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'))

  function Page() {
    return <Component /> // Component is loaded immediately
  }

  // ✅ This works as expected:
  function Page() {
    const [show, setShow] = useState(false)
    return show && <Component /> // Component loads only when show is true
  }
  ```

  Unless the component is conditionally rendered, `next/dynamic` will still load and hydrate it on initial page load. This package uses IntersectionObserver and a few tweaks to enable pre-rendering while deferring hydration.

### Next.js Compatibility

- Perfect for Pages Router
- For App Router, use built-in streaming
- Works with Next.js 12 and above

## Common Questions

### Q: Does it affect SEO?

A: No! Content is still pre-rendered, so search engines see everything immediately.

### Q: What's the browser support?

A: Works in all modern browsers that support IntersectionObserver (IE11+ with polyfill).
